            Mary, a late in life widow
          </accordion-heading>
          Mary was widowed at age 82.  Her husband had been a very astute businessman and had handled all of their financial affairs.  She had no involvement in their finances except for paying their monthly bills.  As a result, when he died she had no idea if she could comfortably stay in their house and belong to the country club which was most of her social network.  Her two adult children were living out of town and were there to comfort her initially but knew they would have to leave soon.  They attempted to gather together whatever financial records they could find but didn’t know what to do next.  We were brought in for a family meeting, we got to know them, and they decided to hire us.  We then started to organize and analyze what Mary had to work with.  We helped collect the life insurance proceeds, consolidated the personal accounts, planned for regular income to come to Mary, and took over the day to day management of the money.  Mary’s family was able to talk with us by phone about any issues which arose and we were able to help Mary know that her money was running smoothly and she had no worries about not having enough.  Even though she was in mourning, she knew she was being well cared for. One of her children chose to receive copies of all statements and transactions and we continue to meet for reviews.  At tax time, we communicate directly with Mary’s CPA to make sure he has all the proper information for filing, including cost basis on positions which have been sold during the year.

            George and Becky, recently inherited her mother’s money
          </accordion-heading>
          I knew this couple because we worked together for many years on one of my volunteer activities.  Her mother had recently died and they asked to meet with me.  Her mother had left a sizable estate to Becky and her three siblings.  Becky and George were working with the attorney to help their siblings decide what to do with an inherited IRA and a house to sell.  They needed to look at several scenarios.  They were not pleased with their mother’s broker because he had made very few adjustments in her portfolio as she had become older and the markets had become more volatile.  She was heavily concentrated in stocks which had been held with no real review for many years.  The account values were dropping rapidly in 2008 and the broker was unresponsive to their concerns.  With some strategy and input from us they were able to determine which positions should be held for the long term, which siblings wanted to take those positions as part of their portion, and which positions should be liquidated immediately by the broker still holding the assets prior to the distribution from the estate.  Two of the heirs decided to continue to use their current investment advisors in their own home towns, Becky and George consolidated their accounts at Shankland Financial  Advisors, LLC and one sister hired us to oversee her accounts because she did not have any good financial advisory relationships in place.  We took over the management of their 401k’s at their employers and updated their life insurance to the appropriate amounts.  From then on we have met at least annually to review changes in their circumstances and monitor their progress toward retirement.

            Sam and Bob, the next generation
          </accordion-heading>
          I can still remember their father.  He was a very conservative farmer in Missouri.  He saw me on WGEM in 1980 doing a market report and gave me a call.  He was interested in tax free bonds.  I recall getting him 14 per cent in a tax free issue that he held until maturity.  After rates fell to under 5 per cent he would wistfully ask me if I couldn’t manage to find him some more of those 14 per cent bonds.  He passed away several years ago, but I have the pleasure of still working with his sons, who continue to run the farm.  We manage their IRA’s and their personal accounts and watch over the 401K at one of their employers.  Sam’s wife also has a 401K at her employer which I monitor to make sure it is invested properly for current market conditions.  Their life insurance is up to date and they know they are right on track for retirement, even though farmers never really retire. They just give up their second job at some point.

            An emergency from a CPA
          </accordion-heading>
          A CPA we work with called on a weekend because he had clients over 80 years old who were having severe second thoughts about paperwork they had signed the previous week.  They called him for his advice.  Their long time insurance agent had met with them and convinced them to put a very large amount of money into some sort of product they did not understand but “paid 6 per cent somehow.” This decision had felt pressured to them, and they were losing sleep.  I met with them the next day and unfortunately, they had reason to worry.  They had no written information about the product they were being sold, and they said their agent did not know their net worth or the assets they had in place.  Therefore, he did not have sufficient information to make such a sizable recommendation.  I reassured them that the paperwork could be stopped as what they were recommended was an annuity and would have a 30 day free look period.  They called to cancel it immediately on Monday morning.  They asked for copies of the product information and their paperwork and their agent would not provide it.  At that point they were very glad to have stopped the investment.  From that point forward, we worked together to organize and coordinate their financial affairs.  Working with their attorney, we have updated their estate plan to provide for a smooth transition to their heirs.  Their money is being managed within their objectives, and I treasure our relationship.

            Financial Housekeeping and Income Analysis needed for William
          </accordion-heading>
          One of our attorney contacts had just completed the process of a husband having to get guardianship over his wife, who had Alzheimer’s. The attorney contacted us because the husband needed to have us create an accounting of their various assets to present to the court in his capacity as guardian.  We were able to organize their financial data in a clear fashion and guide him as to the appropriate next steps.  They had too many aggressive positions spread out across numerous accounts for their ages and risk tolerances.  We gave them our recommendations on the assets best suited to create the income he needed on an ongoing basis, and he was able to implement the changes with the help of his son.  Instead of hiring us for investment management it made more sense to advise them using an hourly rate for financial planning.  We were able to provide the asset list and analysis in a timely fashion to meet the court deadline and the attorney was pleased to have had an experienced, thorough analysis.

            An archeological dig  through Peter’s office
          </accordion-heading>
          A long-standing client was a very successful professional who worked long, tough hours and loved what he did.  He accumulated many investments over the years from a variety of brokers.  I saw him often and managed quite a bit of his money, but knew he had other relationships with other brokers out of town as well.  As he got older, I encouraged him to pull together lists of all that he had in place to determine what he had for his retirement.  He was reluctant to do so because he was always too busy.  When he fell ill and I visited him in the hospital he told me he feared he had waited too long to get organized.  I reassured him that I would help him the best that I could, and he instructed me to get busy on the lists.  I had to spend many hours digging through his office to find old stock certificates and statements to research what still had value and what was no longer in place.  His family knew there was no one else truly in a position to do what seemed like a dig for buried treasure. Because we knew what we were looking for, we were able to deposit many certificates of considerable value into his accounts.  We eventually consolidated his accounts at T D Ameritrade where we do all the day to day investment decisions.   He was relieved to have all of his money finally organized.  Some last minute estate planning was needed and accomplished with our urgent recommendation and when he passed away his widow was secure.

          Special child, special needs
          </accordion-heading>
          Julie and John have had their challenges lately. The stress of parenting a special needs child has been hard on them both. They have been terrified of what will happen to their son if either of them dies. Because they had important concerns which needed to be addressed, Julie and John contacted us for help. We discussed how each might be able to support their child by themselves and what would happen to their son if they were both gone. With all the pressures on state budgets they did not want to take their chances on what the state would be able to provide their son in their absence.Working with legal counsel, we were able to build a life insurance plan that provided funds for the surviving spouse to maintain quality care for their son. Upon the death of the second parent, all proceeds for the benefit of the son will be held in a Special Needs Trust. The Special Needs Trust will provide additional funding without reducing his state benefits. Julie and John are now much more comfortable knowing expenses considered “extra” or “unqualified” can be covered by the trust and continue a better lifestyle for their son.

            A small business with a smooth transition
          </accordion-heading>
          Al loved to work on cars, any kind of cars. After high school he was working at a local auto repair shop with a friend. The shop ran like a clock, and after a few years the two were offered the opportunity to buy the shop from the owner. Al got some very good advice from his father. “Get a good attorney, a good accountant and a good financial guy. Get them together and have a plan to protect each other and your families.” Al took his father’s advice and soon they had a Buy/Sell agreement funded by life insurance. The agreement assured that should either partner die, the survivor would have the funds to buy out the partner’s spouse and pay off any debt.
<br/><br/>
Fast forward to 2008. Al’s partner and friend had just passed away. The financial markets were collapsing and credit was practically frozen. The proceeds from the Buy/Sell agreement policy allowed Al to pay the grieving spouse fair value for her husband’s interest in the business, and Al was able to pay off some remaining debt. While businesses were closing all around him, Al was the sole owner of a business with no debt. He could pay all his bills upon delivery, allowing him to get discounts for fast payment. Other repair shops around him closed due to the economy. 
<br/><br/>
Today, Al’s business is booming. His current life insurance policy allows his business to pay him a bonus which pays for the policy (an executive bonus plan). His family is protected and he will be able to pull money from the policy tax free in the future. 
<br/><br/>
Policies tied to business interests must be put in place using close coordination between accounting, legal and financial professionals. Al’s business thrived because he and his partner took the action to get sharp, coordinated advice and then implemented the plan.

            "We’re all set, so why do a life insurance review?"
          </accordion-heading>
          Dave and Helen really didn’t understand why we wanted to discuss their life insurance during our annual review. It was a natural response. As much as it is important to help our clients accumulate and manage assets, it is also critical that we examine their life insurance. We need to determine if they have the proper amount and the correct type of insurance to create proper performance over time. We like to see that families are given as many options as possible. Our evaluations are geared to make sure that plans are “water tight” and that families use their resources wisely.
<br/><br/>
          We found their policies were in fine shape, had plenty of cash value and would last for a long time. However, because they had been in place for many years the policies lacked many of the innovative features of current policies. In a related area, we knew that the cost of long term and critical care was on their minds. They weren’t comfortable being without long term care insurance but weren’t sure If they could afford it. 
<br/><br/>
After some research we found we were able to use the cash value in Dave and Helen’s old policies to create new policies which gave the couple access to long term care/critical care benefits. During their lifetime, if either of them lost two activities of daily living they would have full access to the death benefit. Because we created a pool of dollars which can be used before death, the life insurance policy can help to preserve their retirement assets. If they don’t end up needing expensive long term care, they will preserve the death benefit proceeds to be passed on to their family. This felt like a real win/win situation to them.
